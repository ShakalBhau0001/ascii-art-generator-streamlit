# 🎨 ASCII Art Generator Streamlit

### Text → Colorful ASCII Art — Modern Streamlit App with DOCX & PDF Export

**ASCII Art Generator** is a clean, modern, and beginner-friendly web app built entirely in **Python (3.12.x compatible)**.
It turns any short word or phrase into large, colorful ASCII art — no design tools, no manual character drawing, just type and download.

Using a simple two-panel interface, users can:

- ✍️ Convert any text (up to 20 characters) into block-style ASCII art
- 🎨 Apply live colors directly onto the art — solid, rainbow, gradient, or themed presets
- 👀 See an instant, fully colored preview as they type
- 📄 Download the finished art as a **DOCX** or **PDF** file with colors preserved
- 🧩 Pick from multiple character styles (`@`, `#`, `█`, `▓`, or a custom symbol)

All operations run **fully locally** in the browser via Streamlit — no accounts, no tracking, and no external services.

## ✨ Key Philosophy

ASCII Art Generator follows three core principles:

### 1️⃣ Simplicity First

Type your text, watch the art appear, hit download — no extra steps.

### 2️⃣ What You See Is What You Get

The same color logic drives the on-screen preview, the DOCX export, and the PDF export, so the downloaded file always matches the preview exactly.

### 3️⃣ Modular Architecture

Text engine, color logic, and file exporters are kept in separate modules for easy maintenance and future expansion.

## 🎨 Color Styles

Color is calculated per-character and applied directly onto the symbol itself — never shown as a separate swatch.

| Style               | Description                                   |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Solid Color         | One flat color you choose                     |
| Rainbow             | Full-spectrum gradient, left to right         |
| Gradient (2 Colors) | Smooth blend between two colors you pick      |
| Fire                | Ready-made warm red → orange → gold theme     |
| Ocean               | Ready-made deep blue → cyan theme             |
| Neon                | Ready-made pink → purple → blue → green theme |
| Pastel              | Soft, low-saturation rainbow                  |

### Use Cases

> Themed banners, mood-based art, brand-colored text graphics

## 📄 Export Formats

| Format  | Color Support | Notes                                   |
| ------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `.docx` | ✅ Yes        | Opens in Microsoft Word / Google Docs   |
| `.pdf`  | ✅ Yes        | Auto-switches to landscape for wide art |

> ℹ️ Plain `.txt` is intentionally **not offered** — text files have no way to store color, and color is the whole point of this app.

- Unsupported characters may not render — stick to standard letters, numbers, and punctuation
- Internet connection is only required for the initial `pip install`

---

## 🛣️ Roadmap

- Multi-line / multi-word text support
- Additional character ramps and fonts
- Adjustable font size in exports
- Save/share preset color themes
- Standalone desktop packaging
